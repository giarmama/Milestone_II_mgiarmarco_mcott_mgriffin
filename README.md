# Predicting the Impact of Air Quality on Public Transportation Usage

**Team 9 – SIADS 693: Milestone II**  

## Project Overview

This project investigates the relationship between air quality and public transportation ridership in two U.S. cities: Chicago and New York. Using historical weather, air quality, and transit data from 2023–2024, we aim to evaluate the extent to which environmental factors can explain or predict daily ridership patterns.

## Required Libraries

Install the following Python packages:

*pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost shap matplotlib seaborn requests_cache geopy openmeteo-requests holidays*
